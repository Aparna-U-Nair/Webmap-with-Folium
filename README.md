# Webmap-with-Folium
A Webmap is created upon two different dataset, purely in python. The libraries explored here are pandas and folium.

folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the leaflet.js library. We can manipulate our data in Python and then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via folium. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.

pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,built on top of the Python programming language.

### Requirements
```sh
pip install pandas
pip install folium
```
